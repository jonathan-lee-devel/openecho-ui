OpenEcho is an open-source project which is intended to provide feedback mechanisms for websites. There are plenty of services which offer this type of functionality, but many are not flexible and many are far too expensive. The goal of this project is to allow for free feedback to be obtained and for incredible flexibility to be achieved.
